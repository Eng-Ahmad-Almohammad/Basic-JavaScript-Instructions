# Basic JavaScript Instructions
## STATEMENTS 
### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a *statement*. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
## COMMENTS 
### You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 
## WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 
## Variables: how to declare them
### Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. Programmers say that you *Declare the variable*.

## Variables: how to assign them a value
### Once you have created a variable, you can tell it what information you would like it to store for you. Programmers say that you *assign a value* to the variable.

## DATA TYPES 
### JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans. 
### 1- *NUMERIC DATA TYPE*: The numeric data type handles numbers.
### 2- *STRING DATA TYPE*: The strings data type consists of letters and other characters. 
### 3- *BOOLEAN DATA TYPE* Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false. 
## ARRAYS 
### An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
## CREATING AN ARRAY
### You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array).
### The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.
