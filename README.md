# Basic JavaScript Instructions
## STATEMENTS 
### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a *statement*. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
## COMMENTS 
### You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 
## WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 
## Variables: how to declare them
### Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. Programmers say that you *Declare the variable*.

## Variables: how to assign them a value
### Once you have created a variable, you can tell it what information you would like it to store for you. Programmers say that you *assign a value* to the variable.
